# Predicting-Molecule-Toxicity
Deep Learning approaches used to predict the toxicity of molecules in Fathead minnow based on different representations/featurisations. 

Predicting the toxicity of molecules in different species is very important when designing a drug or material that can end up in the environment so that minimal damage is done to the ecosystem. There are several methods to represent and featurise molecules in addition to several learning methods that can be used for this problem. 

Here, two methods are shown. 

1. ANNs trained on molecular descriptors from the RDKit and Mordred descriptor libraries, and on Morgan Fingerprints. 
2. A CNN trained on graph representations of the molecular structures. 

These methods are part of a larger study comparing different techniques for predicting molecular toxicity for comparision of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
